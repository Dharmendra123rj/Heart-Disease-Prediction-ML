## Introduction

Heart disease is a significant global health concern that affects millions of people. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various clinical and non-clinical factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/your_dataset_link) and consists of a collection of features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc., along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
   ```
   jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```
   python heart_disease_prediction.py
   ```

2. Follow the code and comments to understand the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
- Model Selection: Trying out various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc.).
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

## Results

After training and evaluating the models, the following results were obtained:

- Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 85%, Precision - 82%, Recall - 88%
- Random Forest: Accuracy - 88%, Precision - 85%, Recall - 90%
- Support Vector Machine: Accuracy - 84%, Precision - 80%, Recall - 87%

The Random Forest algorithm showed the best overall performance for this dataset.
